"""coder-scope: a PreToolUse hook that holds a coder subagent to its granted nodes.

Reads one hook input (JSON) on standard input. A call of anything but a coder is allowed
unread. A coder's call is judged against the scope file of its agent id
(`<repo>/.claude/scopes/agent-<agent_id>.json`), whose `worktree` field names the directory
the coder is confined to, and is refused, with a reason, when it reads outside the read set
of AGENTS.md section 3 or writes outside the scope's write patterns. The hook input's `cwd`
is only the directory shell commands start from and relative paths resolve against.
The contract is tools/coder-scope/API.md; the rules are tools/coder-scope/BOOT.md.
